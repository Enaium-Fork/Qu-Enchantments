1.2.1-1.19
New:
- Added Korean translation thanks to gyular (#7)

Fixes/Changes:
- Optimizations
- New enchantment logic handling system (should not cause any noticeable changes in behavior)
- Runes now will only take damage when that particular stack applies the effect
- Slight change to Reflection, may now possibly reflect more projectiles than just Persistent Projectiles
